# Linux Client/Daemon - Portal Configuration

**The configuration file is a yaml (yml) based file, here is a example file to start with**

## Portal

### Url

The url of the Web Management Portal, if you use a self-hosted portal we recommand that you use ssl and/or only allow your own ip's connecting to the portal.

### Api Key

The api key used to connect to the portal, keep this safe and don't publish this key. We recommand creating a special api key only used by this client.

### Yaml example

portal:
  - url: "https://example.com/"
  - api-key: "vxufsdnvdf√ß!gdjfkhgjkhfdg"
```
